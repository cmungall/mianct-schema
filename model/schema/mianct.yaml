  When should one provide an entry for a cell type in a MIANCT sheet?

   - When there is a claim of a new cell class (type or state) that has not been described before
   - When new information is discovered for a previously cataloged type that might influence its cataloguing (i.e. description of the presence in a different species or in a new location)
   - When a cell type mentioned in the article has been described before, but is not yet catalogued on an authoritative source like the Cell Ontology.
